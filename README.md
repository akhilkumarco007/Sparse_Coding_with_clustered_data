# Sparse_Coding_with_clustered_data
Sparse Coding applied to clustered data
The project includes the code for feature generation from Gaze data of a chest X-ray using Sparse represenation technique. The Gaze data is collected using a Tobii Eye Tracker for chest X-ray images.

The collected gaze data is chopped into smaller sequences. The sequences are clustered using unsupervised learning algorithms and then they are made ready for sparse representation. Using sparse representation, the important patterns that represent the gaze of a radiologist for a given image can be obtained. TensorFlow is used for the purposes of this project.
